# META (an ocamlfind library specification) is necessary for rocq to find the plugin
# in tuto0 we use rocq makefile's "-generate-meta-for-package"
# it assumes that the plugin is called rocq-plugin-tutorial.plugin
# and depends on ltac1 (rocq-runtime.plugins.ltac)
# see tuto1 for an example of a custom META file

# rocq makefile uses -I to tell the ocaml compiler where previously compiled files are located
# (in our case g_tuto0 depends on tuto0_main)
