# rocq makefile uses -I in 2 ways:
# to tell rocq where the META file is located
-I .
# and to tell the ocaml compiler where previously compiled files are located
# (eg g_tuto1 depends on inspector)
-I src
# in tuto0 with -generate-meta-for-package, the META was generated next to the mlpack
# so -I src did both jobs
