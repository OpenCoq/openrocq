                       └─────────────────┘
```

#### 2. API Design Principles
- **Asynchronous Operations**: All cognitive operations should be non-blocking
- **Incremental Learning**: Support continuous learning from user interactions
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain proof state context across interactions
- **Performance Isolation**: Cognitive features should not impact core proving performance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Cognitive Assistant (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)

#### 1.1 IDE Integration Architecture

**Goal**: Seamless integration of cognitive assistance into existing IDEs.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension for cognitive features
- Real-time proof state analysis and suggestion generation
- User preference learning and adaptation

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **LSP Extension Design**
   ```ocaml
   (* cognitive_lsp.ml *)
   type cognitive_request = 
     | SuggestTactic of proof_state
     | ExplainError of error_context
     | FindLemma of goal_context
     | LearnFromProof of proof_trace

   type cognitive_response =
     | TacticSuggestions of tactic list * confidence
     | ErrorExplanation of explanation * fixes
     | LemmaRecommendations of lemma list * relevance
     | LearningConfirmation of unit
   ```

2. **Proof State Analysis**
   ```ocaml
   (* proof_analyzer.ml *)
   module ProofAnalyzer = struct
     let analyze_goal goal =
       let context = goal.context in
       let conclusion = goal.conclusion in
       let cognitive_context = CognitiveEngine.create_context context conclusion in
       CognitiveEngine.suggest_tactics cognitive_context
   end
   ```

3. **Integration Points**
   - Hook into Rocq's proof engine at key decision points
   - Maintain cognitive context parallel to proof state
   - Implement feedback loops for learning from user actions

#### 1.2 Attention-Based Proof Search

**Goal**: Use ECAN attention mechanisms to guide automated proof search.

module AttentionSearch = struct
  type search_node = {
    goal: Constr.t;
    attention: float;
    depth: int;
    parent: search_node option;
  }

  let search_with_attention goal_stack =
    let rec search nodes =
      match highest_attention nodes with
      | None -> None (* Search exhausted *)
      | Some node -> 
          let tactics = CognitiveEngine.suggest_tactics node.goal in
          let new_nodes = apply_tactics tactics node in
          search (update_attention (nodes @ new_nodes))
    in
    search [{ goal = initial_goal; attention = 1.0; depth = 0; parent = None }]
end
```

  related_concepts: concept list;
}

type relationship = 
  | Subtype of concept * concept
  | Dependency of concept * concept
  | Analogy of concept * concept * similarity_score

module KnowledgeGraph = struct
  type t = {
    concepts: (string, concept) Hashtbl.t;
    relationships: relationship list;
    attention_network: ECAN.t;
  }

  let add_theorem graph theorem =
    let concepts = extract_concepts theorem in
    let relationships = infer_relationships concepts in

      let deps = extract_dependencies thm in
      { theorem = thm; dependencies = deps; cognitive_tags = tags;
        usage_frequency = 0; proof_complexity = estimate_complexity thm }
    ) theorems
end
```
